Rules for creating variable names in Python:
1. Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore (_).
2. Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
3. Variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., myVar and myvar are different variables).
4. Avoid using Python keywords (e.g., def, class, if) as variable names.
